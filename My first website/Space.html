                      The original perspective of Earth was that we were the center our universe on our flat rock but eventuraly people dubed Earth sperical 
                      and even later we were dubed the third planet from the sun. but lets go back a bit to what we presumed was the center of the solar system
                      were a man called Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher told or imagined that the earth was spherical. He told this in 6th century BC. It is 
                      said that Columbus may have said or invented that the earth is not flat. It is round. Otherwise, on his voyage he may have fallen from the 
                      edge of the earth. In 1492, Columbus has set out to discover new land. He ends up to the conclusion that it is the shape of the earth 
                      that leads him to various lands, but it has no boundary or end. The final and valid information has given by Galileo Galilee. Later there
                      was a uproar that earth was not in the center of the solar sytem and we won, since then people have comon knowlage that earth is third from 
                      the sun.

                    Most of the world beleves that the world started with The Big Bang and we here at 
                    M.M.M beleve this to, There was nothing thing in the sky but then the 
                    most powerful thing happend. The Big Bang. A storm of gases and elements swirled 
                    up into each other, others spirling outward into the abis of darkness bringing a 
                    sheild of light with it. The begining of everything had began, a couple million 
                    years later the Sun began to take shape and, along with it, the planets. Jupiter 
                    was the first gas giant to enter our solar system. Due to its sise the Sun had 
                    a bigger grasp on the planet. Jupiter crashed into the begining of Mars and Earth 
                    a bit of Venus. Suddenly Jupiter flung back into its current possition thanks to 
                    Saturn. Once Eath was formed it was a giat lavascape with geasers of molten magma 
                    blasting out and Mars was almost exsactly like Earth is now, then Earth nocked Mars
                    out of the 'Goldielocks Zone' and destroyed Mars's atmousphere. Earth soon became 
                    luxuryous and inhabited life such as mamals and dinosaurs. Meanwhile Jupiter atracted
                    a dwaf/normal planet called Pluto. Later a Metorite smashed into Earth wiping out 
                    dinosaurs leaving the mamals room to live their lives with no fear. a couple millons
                    of years later we avolved and made technology which we use to make sites like this!

                    The International Space Station (The ISS) is the second space ship to launch with 
                    international crew bording in and out of it constantly. It is mainly run by the 
                    Russian commanders on Earth so the main requirement is to know Russian. Because of 
                    the low gravity on The ISS crew must work out for 2 hours a day. Certain foods arn't 
                    alowed on the ship because they might get into the ventalation system.
